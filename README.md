# Email

This repository contains an 'Email.java' program and an 'email.input' file.

The 'Email.java' program asks the user for necessary information about the email exchange 
and then utilizes a client socket to send commands to smtp.chapman.edu server 
on port 25 with user's info to execute email.

The Email.java program can also take input from the email.input file.
